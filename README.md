# cyberia.blog

the chronicle of the project, and the place the whole knowledge graph lives.

the homepage is the [[blog]]. filter it by topic: [[cyber]] · [[cyb]] · [[soft3]] · [[cyberia]].

the protocol itself — small, readable, one subject — stays at [cyber.page](https://cyber.page). this site holds the history, the subgraphs, and the graph that binds them.

## local

```
git clone git@github.com:cyberia-to/cyberia-blog.git ~/cyber/cyberia-blog
cd ~/cyber/cyberia-blog

nu scripts/serve.nu       # full graph at localhost:8888
nu scripts/build.nu       # static build
nu scripts/deploy.nu      # rsync build/ → cyberproxy
```
